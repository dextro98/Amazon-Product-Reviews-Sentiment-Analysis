# Amazon-Product-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview

Amazon is an American multinational corporation that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence products. But it is mainly known for its e-commerce platform which is one of the biggest online shopping platforms today. There are so many customers buying products from Amazon that today Amazon earns an average of $ 638.1 million per day. So having such a large customer base, it will turn out to be an amazing data science project if we can analyze the sentiments of Amazon product reviews.

The dataset Iâ€™m using for the task of Amazon product reviews sentiment analysis was downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset contains the product reviews of over 568,000 customers who have purchased products from Amazon.
